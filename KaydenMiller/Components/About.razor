                                In my free time I enjoy working on my side projects as well as building and painting scale models. Amongst this hobby I also have several others,
                                such as being the Dungeon Master for my friends D&amp;D campaign. I also have a love for board games especially ones that are complex such as Battletech and Axis &amp; Allies.
